        Q1: What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
        the experience?
      </summary>
      <div class="answer-box">
        I noticed the parallax movement in the 3D scene as the mouse moved,
        creating spatial immersion and making the interface feel interactive and
        alive.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>
        Q2: Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
        your discrete actions.
      </summary>
      <div class="answer-box">
        Mouse movement, hover effects, scroll-triggered transitions, button
        clicks, 3D object interactions (like shooting, dragging, toggling), and
        dynamic scene replacements based on thumbnail clicks.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>
        Q3: What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
        with?
      </summary>
      <div class="answer-box">
        The interactive 3D objects — especially the mini-games like
        basketball/soccer scenes — where clicking and feedback made me want to
        experiment repeatedly.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>
        Q4: What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
        the experience?
      </summary>
      <div class="answer-box">
        Mouse hover and scrolling were the most repeated actions — used to
        navigate scenes and reveal microinteractions.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>
        Q5: What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
        interactive experience?
      </summary>
      <div class="answer-box">
        The goal is immersive brand storytelling and exploration — using
        interactivity to enhance user engagement and deliver information in a
        playful way.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>
        Q6: How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </summary>
      <div class="answer-box">
        It uses dynamic visual feedback, 3D animations, scroll effects, and
        reactive UI components to encourage discovery and play.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>
        Q7: What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
        with over time?
      </summary>
      <div class="answer-box">
        Designed for short but repeatable interactions — first visit for
        exploration (3–5 mins), return visits to specific sections like app
        previews or team info.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>
        Q8: How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </summary>
      <div class="answer-box">
        It uses scroll-reveal structures, expandable content, and replayable
        elements (games, rewards) to suggest that it's worth coming back to.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>
        Q9: What other media forms does the experience reference?
      </summary>
      <div class="answer-box">
        Video games (UI/UX), interactive 3D sites (like Apple Vision Pro), and
        immersive brand installation concepts (experience centers).
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>
        Q10: What does this reference communicate to you about how you should
        act when engaging with the experience?
      </summary>
      <div class="answer-box">
        It tells me to interact actively, like a player in a game — try
        clicking, dragging, exploring, and even "breaking" elements to find
        more.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>
        Q11: What does this reference communicate to you about how you should
        feel when engaging with the experience?
      </summary>
      <div class="answer-box">
        Curious, playful, immersed — like exploring a fun and beautifully
        designed playground where discovery is rewarded.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>
        Q12: What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and
        what makes that part frustrating?
      </summary>
      <div class="answer-box">
        Some interactive objects are not clearly signposted as clickable. The
        transitions are sometimes too long or unskippable, which slows down
        flow.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>
        Q13: What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?
      </summary>
      <div class="answer-box">
        The mini-game elements (like shooting/goal scoring) and responsive UI
        transitions made the experience engaging and visually rewarding.
      </div>
